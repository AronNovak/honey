To make the module working correctly, it's needed to make sure
that the nmap command-line utility is installed and available in
the webserver's PATH.

To figure out the PATH of the webserver, you may create a little
temporary PHP script (or using devel module):
--
<?php
system('echo $PATH');
--
If you use devel, don't enter the first line.
